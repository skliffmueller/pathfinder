# Pathfinder

A silly little project. A robot spawns, it only has a 48x1 pixel resolution scanner in the front of it, and two wheels each with independent motors.

In the demo, you will see to the right of the screen, a historical feed of what the robot sees, along with meters to show the acceleration level per motor. If the right motor has higher acceleration than the left motor, the robot turns right, if the motors have the same acceleration, the robot moves forward.
